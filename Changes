Revision history for MooseX-Types-Moose-Overload

0.06    July 5, 2009
        We now return fresh copies of the base types and work
        with MooseX::Types::Moose.

0.05    July 6, 2009
        We now work in a more MooseX::Types fashion. Please see
        the section on future proofing. Much of the current behavoir
        is viewed as a side-effect of not cloning MXT:Moose's types.

0.02    Added MooseX::Types as a requirement

0.01    Dec 15, 2008
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
